# Workspace Demo

A demonstration repository for workspace management architecture and AI agent coordination.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical example for discussions around:

- **Multi-project development workflows**
- **AI agent activity tracking and coordination** 
- **Workspace management architecture patterns**
- **File-based vs database-backed coordination systems**

## Architecture Overview

This demo is part of a larger workspace management system that includes:

```
workspace/
├── workspace-config.json     # Project definitions and user settings
├── workspace-activity.json   # AI agent activity tracking
├── projects/                 # All development projects (including this one)
│   ├── uhc-clusters-service/
│   ├── ocm-cli/
│   ├── access-transparency-service/
│   └── workspace-demo/      # This repository
├── notes/                   # Cross-project documentation
├── tasks/                   # Coordinated task management
└── scripts/                 # Automation and tooling
```

## Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Unified Project Management**
- Single configuration file manages 13+ repositories
- Cross-platform support (GitHub + GitLab)
- Automated remote configuration and branch management

### 2. **AI Agent Activity Tracking**
- Real-time task coordination between multiple AI agents
- Complete audit trail of development activities
- Context preservation across sessions

### 3. **Monodirectory Benefits**
- All projects accessible in single workspace
- Unified search across entire codebase
- Shared tooling and automation scripts



## Getting Started

This repository is designed to be part of a larger workspace. To see it in action:

1. Clone the parent workspace
2. Run workspace priming to set up all projects
3. Observe AI agent coordination through activity logs
4. Experience cross-project development workflows
