# Workspace Demo

A demonstration repository for workspace management architecture and AI agent coordination.

## ðŸš€ Get Started

**ðŸ‘‰ [See DEMO.md for complete setup instructions and walkthrough](./DEMO.md)**

New to this project? Start with the demo guide which includes:
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Configuration requirements  
- Usage examples and scenarios
- Architecture explanations

## Quick Start

1. **Configure credentials**: Edit `workspace-config.json` and update your GitHub/GitLab usernames
2. **Run setup**: `./scripts/setup.sh` to validate your configuration
3. **Prime workspace**: Use Claude Code `/workspace:prime` or follow manual setup
4. **Explore**: See the complete walkthrough in [DEMO.md](./DEMO.md)

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical example for discussions around:

- **Multi-project development workflows**
- **AI agent activity tracking and coordination** 
- **Workspace management architecture patterns**
- **File-based vs database-backed coordination systems**

## Architecture Overview

This demo is part of a larger workspace management system that includes:

```
workspace/
â”œâ”€â”€ workspace-config.json     # Project definitions and user settings
â”œâ”€â”€ workspace-activity.json   # AI agent activity tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ projects/                 # All development projects (including this one)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ uhc-clusters-service/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ocm-cli/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ access-transparency-service/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workspace-demo/      # This repository
â”œâ”€â”€ notes/                   # Cross-project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/                   # Coordinated task management
â””â”€â”€ scripts/                 # Automation and tooling
```

## Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Unified Project Management**
- Single configuration file manages 13+ repositories
- Cross-platform support (GitHub + GitLab)
- Automated remote configuration and branch management

### 2. **AI Agent Activity Tracking**
- Real-time task coordination between multiple AI agents
- Complete audit trail of development activities
- Context preservation across sessions

### 3. **Monodirectory Benefits**
- All projects accessible in single workspace
- Unified search across entire codebase
- Shared tooling and automation scripts
