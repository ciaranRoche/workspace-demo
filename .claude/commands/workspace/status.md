# Workspace Status Command for Claude Code

This command provides an interactive overview of workspace activity, displaying completed tasks and allowing users to select and continue incomplete tasks, with mandatory activity logging integration.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure `workspace-activity.json` exists in the workspace root
- Workspace is properly initialized with activity logging
- User has permissions to read and modify workspace files

## MANDATORY FIRST STEPS: Activity Log Integration

### Step 0A: Bootstrap Initialization

**CRITICAL: These files MUST exist and be readable. If any file cannot be read, STOP and inform the user.**

1. **Read Bootstrap Instructions**: 
   - **File Path**: `.claude/bootstrap.md` (relative to current working directory)
   - **Action**: Use Read tool to load this file
   - **Error Handling**: If file doesn't exist or cannot be read, STOP execution and display: "ERROR: Cannot read .claude/bootstrap.md - Bootstrap file is missing or inaccessible. Please ensure this file exists in the workspace."

2. **Load Global Configuration**: 
   - **File Path**: `.claude/config.md` (relative to current working directory)  
   - **Action**: Use Read tool to load this file
   - **Error Handling**: If file doesn't exist or cannot be read, STOP execution and display: "ERROR: Cannot read .claude/config.md - Global configuration file is missing or inaccessible. Please ensure this file exists in the workspace."

3. **Validate Workspace Structure**: 
   - **File Path**: `workspace-activity.json` (relative to current working directory)
   - **Action**: Use Read tool to check if file exists and is valid JSON
   - **Error Handling**: If file doesn't exist, create it with empty structure. If file exists but is invalid JSON, STOP execution and display: "ERROR: workspace-activity.json exists but contains invalid JSON. Please fix or delete this file."

### Step 0B: Activity Log Initialization

**MANDATORY: Follow the exact activity logging protocol defined in the bootstrap and config files.**

1. **Initialize Activity Log**: 
   - **Action**: Read `workspace-activity.json` (already validated in Step 0A)
   - **Purpose**: Load current workspace state and existing tasks
   - **Error Handling**: If JSON parsing fails after validation, STOP execution and display: "ERROR: workspace-activity.json format is corrupted. Please restore from backup or recreate."

2. **Register Agent Session**: 
   - **Action**: Create unique agent ID using format: `claude-agent-{timestamp}`
   - **Purpose**: Identify this specific Claude Code session for coordination
   - **Record**: Log agent registration in workspace activity

3. **Check Active Tasks**: 
   - **Action**: Review `active_tasks` array in workspace-activity.json
   - **Purpose**: Identify conflicts with other active agents and resumable tasks
   - **Conflict Check**: Ensure no conflicts with ongoing status operations

4. **Create Status Check Task**: 
   - **Action**: Generate new task entry with type "workspace-status"
   - **Format**: Follow task structure defined in bootstrap.md
   - **Validation**: Ensure all required fields are populated

### Step 0C: Task Setup
Create task record with the following structure:
```json
{
  "id": "task-{YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm}-workspace-status",
  "type": "workspace-status",
  "project": "workspace",
  "title": "Review workspace activity status and manage tasks",
  "status": "in-progress",
  "assigned_agent": "claude-agent-{timestamp}",
  "created": "2025-07-24T10:00:00Z",
  "last_activity": "2025-07-24T14:30:00Z",
  "context": {
    "operation": "status_review_and_task_management"
  },
  "progress": {
    "completed_steps": [],
    "current_step": "activity-log-read",
    "remaining_steps": ["activity-log-read", "status-analysis", "task-display", "user-interaction", "task-continuation"]
  }
}
```

## Core Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Read and Parse Activity Log

**Log Progress**: Update task progress to "activity-log-read"

Read the `workspace-activity.json` file and parse the current workspace state:
1. Load the complete activity log
2. Extract active tasks, completed tasks, and metrics
3. Validate the structure and identify any inconsistencies
4. Parse task statuses and progress information

**Activity Logging**: Record activity log parsing results and any issues found

### Step 2: Analyze Workspace Status

**Log Progress**: Update task progress to "status-analysis"

Analyze the workspace activity data:
1. **Categorize Tasks by Status**:
   - Completed tasks (status: "completed")
   - Active/In-Progress tasks (status: "in-progress")
   - Paused tasks (status: "paused")
   - Failed tasks (status: "failed")
   - Blocked tasks (status: "blocked")

2. **Identify Task Priorities**:
   - High priority incomplete tasks
   - Tasks that have been stalled for extended periods
   - Tasks with dependencies or conflicts

3. **Calculate Summary Metrics**:
   - Total tasks by type and status
   - Agent activity patterns
   - Task completion rates
   - Time since last activity per task

**Activity Logging**: Record analysis results and task categorization

### Step 3: Display Workspace Status

**Log Progress**: Update task progress to "task-display"

Present a comprehensive status overview:
